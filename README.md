# Study-of-potential-HLA-G-molecule
The aim of this project is to study the potential of HLA-G molecule to be used as a biomarker
to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. HLA-G is a protein expressed in the placenta (organ
connecting the fetus to the mother) and plays and important role in establishment and
maintenance of pregnancy. Its aberrant expression in the mother could lead to adverse
pregnancy outcomes. In this study sHLA-G was detected in the circulation of mothers at
different timepoints during pregnancy. The evolution of sHLA-G molecule during the course
of pregnancy was compared in mothers delivering appropriate for gestational age (AGA)
babies and those delivering small for gestational age (SGA) babies. SGA babies have low
birthweight and suffer from various complications at birth, during childhood and adulthood.
